    <h2>Intro</h2>
    <div class="a">
    <p>Growing up, I lived in a small town. The town had a total of around 500 people in it. 
        <span>There was only a gas station and small town bar. When it came to getting groceries, we 
        had to drive into the "city" to get these.</span> The city was only about a 20 minute drive or so. 
    </p>

    <div class="b">
    <p>My childhood including a lot of working. I was always helping out my dad with a project either 
        for us or for some friends. We would work a lot on houses doing repairs like plumbing, construction,
        roofing, electrical work and so on. When I wasn't working, I was usually hanging out with friends. 
    </p>

    <div class="c">
    <p>Hobbies that I did growing up included skateboarding, riding my bike around the town, hanging out
        with friends, and going to the waterpark. We would go to the waterpark every single day during
        the summer when we were on school break. We did a lot of biking and skateboarding around the town, 
        in neighbors driveways, at the gas station, and usually ended up getting kicked out because we 
        were young kids "causing trouble" in the town.

    <div class="d">
    <p>As I got older, my friend group got smaller and we took on different hobbies. One of the main things 
        that I do today is hunting, fishing, and fourwheeling. We did a lot of bass fishing and even ran tournaments
        for a couple of years in my small town. I was able to be a part of a state fishing tournament which
        created memories I won't forget. Along with those, I spend a lot of time hunting with my best friend on some 
        land that he owns. We always ride the fourwheelers up in Wisconsin a couple of times a year in the state forest
        on hundreds of miles of trails. This is a tradition we have been doing for over 15 years now and something 
        I look forward to every year.
